# Cascade scripts
Scripts used with Cascade M3

The [cascade_populate.sh](cascade_populate.sh) script cleans a Cascade Project, then re-populates it with a Smart Cluster with some Namespaces.

The other scripts are used by the [cascade_populate.sh](cascade_populate.sh) script but can be used independently.

The [cascade_cluster_auth.sh](cascade_cluster_auth.sh) script is a utility to generate a kube configuration file for an existing Smart Cluster.
